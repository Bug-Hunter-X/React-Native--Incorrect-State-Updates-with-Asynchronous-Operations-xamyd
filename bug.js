This React Native bug involves a situation where the state isn't updating correctly, even though the `setState` function is called. This often happens when dealing with asynchronous operations or complex state updates. For instance, if you are using a `setTimeout` function or a fetch request inside a `setState` callback, you could be dealing with stale closures, which could lead to incorrect state updates.

```javascript
// buggy component
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1); // Incorrect update due to stale closure
    }, 1000);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent; 
```
